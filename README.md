Predicting Insurance Charges using Linear Regression

### Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate individual insurance charges based on personal health and demographic information. 
By doing so, we aim to uncover the key drivers of medical costs and provide actionable insights to insurance companies for setting premiums and to individuals for understanding how different factors might affect their insurance expenses.

### Data Description
The dataset consists of several variables that are believed to be influential in determining medical insurance costs:

1. Age: The age of the primary beneficiary.
2. Sex: The gender of the insurance contractor (male or female).
3. BMI: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m^2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9.
4. Children: The number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents.
5. Smoker: Smoking status of the beneficiary (yes or no).
6. Region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
